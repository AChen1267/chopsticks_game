Chopsticks game:

Objective: Make your opponent lose all their fingers (points).

How to play:
The game will prompt you for 3 options: OVERFLOW, SPLIT, and FRIENDLY FIRE. These will be explained throughout the README.
It is recommended that SPLIT is on.
Each player starts out with 1 finger on each hand.
In each turn (turns alternate), the player can ATTACK or SPLIT (if SPLIT is on).

ATTACK: Choose one of your hands and one of your opponent's hands.
The number of fingers on your hand will be added to that of the opponent's chosen hand.
If OVERFLOW is on, the opponent's hand will die (no fingers on the hand) only if the number of fingers of your hand and your opponent's hand add up to 5.
If OVERFLOW is off, the opponent's hand will die if the total is 5 or greater.
If FRIENDLY FIRE is on, then the opponent's hand you choose can be your own hand and the same rules as above apply.

SPLIT: Take the total number of fingers on both your hands and divide them between your hands such that
you end up with a different number of fingers on each hand from the original as well as the original's symmetric position.
For example, if you have 2 fingers in your left hand and 1 finger in your right, you cannot split to have
your left hand have 1 finger and right hand have 2 because that is the symmetric position as the original.
Another rule of splitting is that you cannot split such that one hand loses all fingers.
